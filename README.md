<h1>MICROSERVICES SPORTS (CRICKET T20) PREDICTION SYSTEM</h1>

T20 cricket has gained popularity around the world. It is a game that is almost unpredictable, and so many factors govern the winner of a match that predicting a match result is indeed a challenging task. This system's design, development, and deployment of a T20 cricket prediction system using a microservice architecture combined with machine learning techniques.
